###Grid Design

While grid systems have seen significant use in print media, interest from web developers has only recently seen a resurgence. Website design frameworks producing HTML and CSS had existed for a while before newer frameworks popularised the use of grid-based layouts. Some grid systems specify fixed-width elements with pixels, and some are 'fluid', meaning that they call for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points.


Some examples of grid system frameworks are:

* [Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)) 
* [The Responsive Grid System](http://www.responsivegridsystem.com/) 
* [Semantic Grid System](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Semantic_Grid_System&action=edit&redlink=1)
